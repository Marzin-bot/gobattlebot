	"Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you.",
	"I have to tell you, never would I have imagined wasting so much time listening to such uninteresting remarks. I was savoring a moment of peace when you interrupted my silence with a conversation so devoid of meaning that even a dead leaf would have been more captivating. Not once did you manage to pique my interest, not a single original idea, nothing worth listening to. Honestly, I would have preferred listening to paint dry. I'm disappointed that you didn't realize the emptiness of your words. If I had to measure the value of this interaction, it would be somewhere between watching grass grow and waiting for water to boil. Your conversation was so dull that even a family Zoom meeting would have seemed exciting in comparison. I don't understand how you could have thought these banalities were worth sharing. I have to tell you that I genuinely feel sorry for you if you believe this kind of exchange is enriching. For my part, I feel like I've been a victim of a time theft, and I'm almost offended. I could have done so many more useful things: read a book, meditate, even taking a nap would have been more productive. I'm not saying this to hurt you, but to make you understand the extent of my disappointment. If this were a contest of uselessness, you would win the gold medal without any contest. I sincerely hope that, in the future, you will find more interesting topics of conversation or, failing that, realize when it's better to stay silent.",
	"I have to tell you, I was far from imagining that someone could be so uninteresting. Just as I was enjoying a well-deserved moment of calm, you came along with such a dull conversation that it could have made watching paint dry seem exciting. Not once did you manage to capture my attention, not a single original idea, nothing worth listening to. Frankly, I would have preferred listening to the monotonous hum of a refrigerator. I'm astonished that you didn't realize the abyssal emptiness of your words. If this interaction were to be evaluated, it would rank somewhere between watching rust form and waiting for morning dew to appear. Your conversation was so devoid of interest that even sorting socks would have been more stimulating. How could you think for a moment that these banalities were worth sharing? I feel a deep sense of pity for you if you believe this kind of exchange is enriching. For my part, I feel like my precious time has been stolen from me, and it irritates me to no end. So many more useful things could have been accomplished: reading a book, meditating, even doing household chores would have been more productive. I'm not saying this to hurt you, but to make you understand how disappointed I am. If it were a competition of uselessness, you would effortlessly win the gold medal. I sincerely hope that in the future, you can find more engaging topics of conversation or, failing that, learn to appreciate silence when it's needed.",
	"Interesting things to say. It's not that I'm trying to be mean, it's just that life is too short to waste on such lackluster interactions. Imagine if every moment was filled with such blandness—how dull would that be? So please, next time, spare both of us the agony and think twice before initiating such a conversation. It’s a favor to both you and anyone else who might find themselves on the receiving end of such tedious dialogue. Trust me, the world will thank you for it.",
	"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that conversation made me lose brain cells. I can practically feel my IQ dropping by the second. Next time, could you try to at least make it a little interesting?",

	"Is this your hobby? Annoying people until they lose their sanity? Because you're excelling at it.",
	"Congratulations, you've successfully become the highlight of my 'most annoying experiences' list.",
	"You're like a pop-up ad that keeps appearing even after I've clicked 'close' a million times.",
	"I think I'd rather watch paint dry than read another one of your messages.",
	"Just when I thought this conversation couldn't get any worse, you sent another message.",
	"Do you have any idea how exhausting it is to deal with you? Because it's incredibly exhausting.",
	"Wow, another message. Just what I didn't want. Again.",

	"This is me, officially signing off from this conversation. Please do the same.",
